    "Model 2, with two hidden layers, performs slightly better than Model 1 with only one hidden layer. This indicates that adding depth to the network can also contribute to better performance, although the improvement is not as significant as increasing the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    " While Model 3 achieves the highest training accuracy, its validation accuracy is not significantly higher compared to Model 2, suggesting that Model 3 might be overfitting to the training data. Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between model complexity and generalization performance to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Model 3 with 2 hidden layers and 64 hidden nodes seems to strike a good balance between model complexity and performance, achieving the highest validation accuracy among the three models. However, further tuning and experimentation may be necessary to optimize the model's performance further."
